Harvestify is a smart agriculture system designed to help farmers make better farming decisions through data-driven insights. The project focuses on crop recommendation, plant disease detection, and fertilizer suggestions to improve crop health and overall agricultural productivity.

The system recommends the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH value, and rainfall. This helps farmers select crops that are well-suited to their land and climate, reducing the risk of poor yield.

Harvestify also includes a plant disease detection feature where users can upload images of plant leaves. The system analyzes these images to identify possible plant diseases. Based on the detected disease, it provides fertilizer and treatment suggestions to support healthy plant growth and minimize crop loss.
